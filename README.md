# ADUSTECH-RESULTVERIFICATION-SYSTEM
The method of verifying results at ADUSTECH (Aliko Dangote University of Science and Technology, Wudil) involves manually contacting the university’s administrative offices. This process is not only slow and cumbersome but also prone to human error, resulting in delays and inefficiencies. Additionally, the manual approach makes it difficult for employers and other third parties to verify the results without involving university personnel, creating unnecessary administrative workloads.

This project aims to tackle these challenges by developing an online verification system for final year results. The system will allow authorized institutions and employers to either scan a QR code printed on the result sheet or search for the result using the student’s registration number. This innovation will provide a secure, fast, and reliable method to validate the authenticity of a student's academic record in real-time, thereby safeguarding the university’s reputation and providing confidence to stakeholders.
